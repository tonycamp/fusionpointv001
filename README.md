the version with offset marks and all branches for reverse engine into compressor v 001 .bmx now we can compose the dat file and with the offset of original jpg for instances the size of file of original the number of 1024 bits iterations the storage of the inicial randomtable[iterfinal,inicial] and the number of steps done its randomtable [iterfinal,inicial+numerodeparcelas] we can restore the 10 110 1110 and 1111 of  the 00 01 02 03 and point them out as written and read the restant values bits into those who can not be compressed and in the end we gather the final brach of less than 128 bytes of less than 1024 bits remaining of the file and compose the orginal one
