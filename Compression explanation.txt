the file that is just compressed like jpg mp3 lea paq8o or etc its readed into memory..
the next step its to create a rndom table of several iterations in this case 1Mb iterations can be less for more speed
and also on those  iterations you produce 64 tryouts pointers to a 1024 blockbits
witch means iteration [5 of  1Mb, and 6 of 64 TRYOUTS] for instances have the pointer number 645 of 1024 BLOCK BITS
the next thing its to read the blockbits of 1024 0 and ones
then you produce sometnhing like for the repeat cicle of each iteration you check in sequencial mode if
its 1 and 0 sequencial you store just 00 2 bits
its 1 and 1 and 0 sequencial you store just 01 2 bits
its 1 and 1 and 1 and 0 you store just 02 2 bits
its 1  and 1 and 1 and 1 you store just 03 2 bits
if its zero it break the pattern can not sequencial compress
and in the 64 tryouts generecliy you can point like 14 tryout to 34 tryout of 20 sequencial good tryouts in a specific iteration
it means you sotre like 42 bits of chunks the begging tryout the lenght of tryouts and the specific seed iteration of random table

but that does not solves the remaining not found zeros and ones of the all 1024 bits..
 soo you have  to check witch bits are pointed as  10 110 1110 and 1111 and those which are not you save them in row of bitsw2 

the saving must have first the size of original file into 32 bits integer
the numof iterations of 1024 blocks also a 32 bits integer

the 6 bits number of 64 possibilites of all the beggining pointers of tryouts
the 6 bits number of 64 possibilites of all the lenght of sequencial tryouts

the sequencial chunks of just 2 bits each of each numiter

the real 22 bits representing the seednum iter of 1Mb possibilites of each seed iterfinal number

and you save the remaning bitsw2 into the file also

its should be done but as you know filessizes are not all plain multiple of 128 bytes of the 1024 bits chinks i process each time
soo you save the remaining bytes that shlound be from 128 to 0 tops.

all saved into the compressed dat file on the compressor v001 bmx

its should be reverseble.
